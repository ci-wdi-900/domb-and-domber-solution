# ugly-webby

For our first CSS project, we aren't going to have the difficult job of having a vision in mind and trying to make it happen with CSS. In fact, we're going to be taking a reasonable looking (if not beautiful) site and making it as unreasonable looking as possible.

Fork this repo, then check out style.css. Play with the values, add new property-value combinations (maybe play with the `background-color` property?), add CSS rules for other selectors (`h3` for example doesn't have any rules for it yet!), and just generally mess stuff _up_.

Don't change the html _at all_, but `style.css` is your personal playground.

Or more like your tower of blocks to knock over and your walls to crayon across.

We look forward to seeing what ugly phoenix rises from this repo's ashes. Good luck!
